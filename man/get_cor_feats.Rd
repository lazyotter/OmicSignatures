\title{Compute and Filter Correlation Features}
\usage{
get_cor_feats(
  data,
  features,
  exposure,
  covars,
  parallel,
  ncores = NA,
  cortype = "pearson",
  method = "BH"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the features, exposure, and covariates.}

\item{features}{A character vector or numeric vector indicating which features to test. If numeric, column indices are used.}

\item{exposure}{A character string indicating the exposure variable.}

\item{covars}{A character vector specifying the covariates to adjust for (only used for partial correlation).}

\item{parallel}{Logical; whether to run the computation in parallel.}

\item{ncores}{Integer; number of cores to use for parallel processing (only used if \code{parallel = TRUE}).}

\item{cortype}{Character; type of correlation to compute. Options are \code{"pearson"} or \code{"partial"}.}
}
\description{
Computes correlations (Pearson or partial) between a set of features and an exposure variable,
optionally in parallel. Returns either the full correlation results or a filtered list of significant features.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Pearson correlation on selected features
get_cor_feats(data, features = 1:100, exposure = "alcohol", covars = NULL,
              parallel = TRUE, ncores = 4, cortype = "pearson")

# Partial correlation with covariates
get_cor_feats(data, features = c("feat1", "feat2"), exposure = "alcohol",
              covars = c("age", "sex"), parallel = FALSE, cortype = "partial")

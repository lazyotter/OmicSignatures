\title{Split Data into K Folds}
\usage{
split_k_folds(data, n_folds)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix to be split into folds. The function uses the number of rows to create the folds.}

\item{n_folds}{Integer specifying the number of folds to create.}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{n_folds}, where each element is a vector of row indices corresponding to one fold.
}
\description{
This function splits a dataset into \code{n_folds} approximately equal-sized folds for cross-validation.
Each fold contains a unique set of indices, ensuring no overlap.
}
\details{
This function randomly splits the data into \code{n_folds}. The size of each fold is approximately \code{floor(nrow(data) / n_folds)}.
The last fold contains any remaining rows due to rounding.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Split a dataset into 5 folds
folds <- split_k_folds(iris, 5)
print(folds)
}
